# React Weather app

My second React test app, this one connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to get either a 5 day or a current day forecast for a given city. Plan is to use this as a playground then migrate a socket.io chat repo to React.

# Install

* `npm install`
* `npm run start`
* open localhost:8080
